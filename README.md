# Machine-Learning-Algorithms
This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks which implement commonly used ML algorithms from scratch; i.e., with limited use of statistical python packages. They are based in part on courses I took as part of the University of Washington Machine Learning Specialization. These notebooks have been incredibly useful to me in gaining an intuitive understanding of how these algorithms operate, and what's happening behind the scenes when using packages like scikit-learn and statsmodels.
