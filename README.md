# Machine-Learning-Algorithms
This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks which implement commonly used ML algorithms from scratch; i.e., with limited use of statistical python packages. They are based in part on courses I took as part of the [University of Washington Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/W35H22CMFSTK). These notebooks have been incredibly useful to me in gaining an intuitive understanding of how these algorithms work in practice, and what's happening behind the scenes when using packages like scikit-learn and statsmodels. 

As can be seen above, I have organized the notebooks into three folders based on the type of algorithm: 

1. *Regression*
2. *Clustering*
3. *Others*: This folder contains notebooks for binary decision trees and Local Sensitivity Hashing (LSH).

The data used in these notebooks is available upon request.
